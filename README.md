# AARRP (Assembly ARRay Processing)

TODO: do we want to remove 'assembly' from the name?

AARRP is a homoiconic language designed to express the compilation of anything
to anything through bottom-up abstraction via macros written in anything.

This is done with compilation of code to machine language in mind, but it's open-ended.

* impl folder contains implementations of the language
* notes folder contains general notes
* test\_programs contains test/example/benchmark programs written in aarrp
