# AARRP (Assembly ARRay Processing)

AARRP is a homoiconic assembly language designed to express the compilation of anything
to anything through bottom-up abstraction. This is done with compilation of code to machine language in mind, but it's open-ended.

* impl folder contains implementations of the language
* notes folder contains general notes
* test\_programs contains test/example/benchmark programs written in aarrp
