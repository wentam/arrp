# ARRP (ARRay Processing)

ARRP is a homoiconic language designed to express the compilation of anything
to anything through bottom-up abstraction via macros written in anything.

It's intended to serve as a minimal top-down to bottom-up abstraction turnaround point at as low of a level as possible, and be as unopinionated as possible.

This is done with compilation of code to machine language in mind, but it's open-ended.
