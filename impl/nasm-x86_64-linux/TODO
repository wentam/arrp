* make the macro stack return an id on push and allow you to pop by id
* make aarrp/with-macros pop the macros it pushes by id
* make aarrp/with-macros push a macro that produces an error if there are no supported implementations in the macro spec
* make it so that aarrp/with-macros macro specs can use macros defined previously in the same with-macros.
* rework macro interface and all builtins to not use byte_buffer?
* implement a way to have labels in machine code, perhaps via a macro like aarrp/barry-cat-with-labels
* implement aarrp/with-data and aarrp/data-addr
* implement aarrp/include (as a builtin probably)
* implement x86_64 assembler (not as a builtin, and in machine code)
* set rbp correctly at the start of all function calls?
