* make aarrp/with-macros pop the macros it pushes by id
* make the macro stack return an id on push and allow you to pop by id
* rework macro interface and all builtins to not use byte_buffer?
* allow macros to expand into a "spliced" parray?: (a b (splicy macro)) -> (a b c d e). More notes in notes/misc.md
* implement a way to have labels in machine code, perhaps via a macro like aarrp/barry-cat-with-labels or maybe there's a way to make arbitrary "label scopes" independent from cat
* implement aarrp/with-data and aarrp/data-addr
  * make sure it can support arbitrary aarrp structures, see notes/misc.md
* implement aarrp/include (as a builtin probably)
* implement x86_64 assembler (not as a builtin, and in machine code)
